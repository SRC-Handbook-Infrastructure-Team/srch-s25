For re-identification (or deanonymization), it’s possible to use the data of an anonymous user to successfully re-identify them, extending to [location data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17489725.2024.2385312#abstract), [open datasets shared across platforms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401215301262), and [user metadata](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15010).

This is a form of social network analysis, which has successfully extracted notable individuals, even from [low-information](https://culturalanalytics.org/article/68188-how-network-analysis-uncovers-international-networks-of-smuggling-history-criminals-in-nagasaki-japan-circa-1667), [historical](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) datasets.
