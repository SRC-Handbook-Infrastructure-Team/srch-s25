# Algorithmic Fairness

When machines replace humans in [sidebar:making decisions with such great impact](high-impact), it is important for their outcomes to remain fair. But what is algorithmic fairness?

## Procedural Equality vs. Equity

One common criteria for fairness within the technical community is procedural equality.

**Procedural Equality**: Everyone is subject to the same decision-making process.

For example, ATS, or applicant tracking systems, are automated decision-making systems that employers use to screen resumes based on keywords and qualifications.

## Definitions of Algorithmic Fairness

Different stakeholders define fairness differently:

- **Equality**: Treating everyone the same regardless of circumstances
- **Equity**: Accounting for historical and systemic disadvantages [sidebar:Learn About Group Fairness](group-fairness)

## Individual vs. Group Fairness

- **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals should receive similar outcomes [sidebar:Explore Individual Fairness](individual-fairness)
- **Group Fairness**: Different demographics should receive comparable treatment

## Protected Attributes

Algorithmic fairness often involves consideration of [sidebar:protected attributes](protected-attributes) - characteristics that are legally protected from discrimination.

## Applications

Modern machine learning systems make high-impact decisions in many contexts:

- Resume screening tools
- Predictive policing algorithms
- Credit scoring models [sidebar:Learn about Scoring Systems](credit-scoring)
- Healthcare diagnostic systems

Each of these systems raises important fairness considerations, and researchers have developed various methods to define and measure fairness in these contexts.
