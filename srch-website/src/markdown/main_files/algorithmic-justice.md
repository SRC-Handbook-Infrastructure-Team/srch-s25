# Algorithmic Justice

Algorithmic justice extends beyond fairness to consider broader impacts of algorithmic systems on society, including power dynamics, historical injustices, and systemic inequalities.

## Beyond Technical Fairness

While algorithmic fairness often focuses on mathematical criteria and statistical parity, algorithmic justice considers:

- **Historical context** of discrimination and marginalization
- **Power asymmetries** between decision-makers and those affected by decisions
- **Participation and voice** of affected communities in system design and implementation
- **Accountability mechanisms** for algorithmic harms [sidebar:Accountability Frameworks](accountability)

## Participatory Design

Justice-oriented approaches often emphasize [sidebar:participatory design](participatory-design), which involves communities affected by algorithmic systems in their design, development, and governance.

## Algorithmic Impact Assessments

Many justice-oriented frameworks recommend impact assessments before deploying high-risk systems, examining potential:

- Discriminatory effects
- Privacy impacts
- Accessibility concerns [sidebar:Accessibility in AI Systems](accessibility)
- Environmental considerations
- Economic disruption

## Key Differences from Technical Fairness

Justice-focused approaches differ from purely technical fairness in several ways:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: Considers algorithms within broader sociotechnical systems
2. **Power Analysis**: Examines who benefits and who is harmed by algorithmic systems
3. **Process Focus**: Emphasizes fair processes for development and governance, not just outcomes
4. **Structural Change**: Aims to address root causes of inequities, not just mitigate symptoms

## Ethical Frameworks

Various ethical frameworks have been developed to guide the creation of more just algorithmic systems:

- Value-sensitive design
- Feminist and anti-racist approaches to technology
- Capability approaches to technology ethics
- Decolonial computing
