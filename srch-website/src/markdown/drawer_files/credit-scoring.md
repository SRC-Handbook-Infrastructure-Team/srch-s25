# Credit Scoring Systems

Credit scoring systems are algorithmic tools used to predict the likelihood that a borrower will repay a loan or credit obligation, typically expressed as a numerical score.

## Common Credit Scoring Factors

Traditional credit scoring models consider factors such as:

- Payment history (35%)
- Amounts owed (30%)
- Length of credit history (15%)
- New credit (10%)
- Credit mix (10%)

Alternative data credit scoring may also consider:
- Rental payments
- Utility payments
- Mobile phone payments
- Bank account transactions
- Education and employment history

## Fairness Concerns in Credit Scoring

Credit scoring raises several fairness concerns:

1. **Historical Bias**: Models trained on historical data may perpetuate past discriminatory lending practices
2. **Disparate Impact**: Seemingly neutral factors may disproportionately affect protected groups
3. **Limited Data**: Some groups have limited credit histories ("credit invisibles")
4. **Proxy Variables**: Some variables may serve as proxies for protected characteristics
5. **Feedback Loops**: Denial of credit can lead to further financial exclusion

## Regulatory Frameworks

Credit scoring is regulated by various laws:

- **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)**: Prohibits discrimination in lending
- **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**: Governs the collection and use of credit information
- **Regulation B**: Requires lenders to provide specific reasons for adverse actions

## Fairness Interventions

Various approaches are used to enhance fairness in credit scoring:

1. **Alternative Data**: Using non-traditional data sources to evaluate creditworthiness
2. **Fairness Constraints**: Adding fairness constraints to model objectives
3. **Special Purpose Credit Programs**: Programs designed to increase credit access for disadvantaged groups
4. **Explainability Requirements**: Making credit decisions more transparent and contestable
5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Regular testing and auditing for biased outcomes

## Case Studies
