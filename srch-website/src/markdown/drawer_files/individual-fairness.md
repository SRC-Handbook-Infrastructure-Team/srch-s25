# Individual Fairness

Individual fairness is based on the principle that similar individuals should receive similar outcomes, regardless of group membership.

## Mathematical Definition

The formal definition of individual fairness requires a task-specific similarity metric d(x, x') that measures how similar two individuals x and x' are with respect to the task at hand. 

A classifier f satisfies individual fairness if:

d(x, x') ≤ ε implies |f(x) - f(x')| ≤ δ

where ε and δ are small constants. In words: if two individuals are similar (their distance is small), then their predicted outcomes should also be similar.

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Defining Similarity**: What makes two individuals "similar" is context-dependent and often subjective. Defining an appropriate distance metric is challenging and may embed human biases.

2. **Metric Selection**: Choosing appropriate distance metrics to measure similarity between individuals is complex and requires domain expertise.

3. **Feature Selection**: Determining which characteristics should be considered when assessing similarity can be controversial.

4. **Adaptability**: Individual fairness metrics may need to evolve as societal norms and values change.

## Advantages Over Group Fairness

- Provides fairness guarantees to individuals, not just demographic groups
- Doesn't require sensitive attribute data for deployment (though it may for validation)
- Addresses cases where group fairness is satisfied but individual fairness is violated
- Can protect individuals who belong to unidentified or small subgroups

## Relationship to Other Fairness Concepts

Individual fairness is complementary to group fairness. A system can satisfy group fairness metrics while violating individual fairness, and vice versa. 

For example, a system can treat similar individuals differently while maintaining equal group outcomes, or it can treat similar individuals equally while producing disparate group outcomes.

Individual fairness approaches often involve designing similarity metrics and ensuring that the algorithm's decisions respect these metrics consistently.
