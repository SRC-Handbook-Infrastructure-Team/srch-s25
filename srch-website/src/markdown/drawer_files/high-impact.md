# Making Decisions with Such Great Impact

Examples of high-impact applications:

- **Resume screening**: Determines who gets interview opportunities for jobs
- **Performance assessment**: Affects career advancement and compensation
- **Tenant screening**: Determines access to housing
- **Property appraisal**: Affects wealth building through property values
- **Credit scoring**: Controls access to financial resources
- **Clinical care**: Influences medical treatment decisions
- **Child welfare**: Affects family integrity and child placement
- **Pretrial risk assessment**: Influences pretrial detention decisions
- **Educational performance**: Affects educational opportunities and advancement

These systems can significantly alter people's life opportunities and outcomes, which is why fairness considerations are critical.

## Why Algorithmic Fairness Matters in High-Impact Decisions

1. **Scale**: Algorithmic systems can affect large populations simultaneously
2. **Opacity**: Decision-making processes may be opaque to affected individuals
3. **Automation bias**: Human overseers may defer to algorithmic recommendations
4. **Feedback loops**: Unfair decisions can create data that reinforces future unfairness
5. **Disparate impacts**: Seemingly neutral systems can produce discriminatory outcomes

## Regulatory Approaches

Various regulatory frameworks have emerged to address high-impact algorithmic systems:

- EU's Artificial Intelligence Act classifies systems by risk level
- New York City's algorithmic accountability law requires auditing of hiring algorithms
- Illinois' AI Video Interview Act requires consent and transparency in automated hiring

These frameworks aim to ensure that high-impact systems are properly assessed and monitored for potential harms.
