# Group Fairness

Group fairness focuses on ensuring that different demographic groups receive comparable treatment from algorithmic systems.

## Key Concepts in Group Fairness

### Independence

The decision should be independent of protected attributes. Formally:

P(Ŷ | A=a) = P(Ŷ | A=a') for all values a, a' of the protected attribute A

This means the algorithm's decisions should not correlate with protected attributes.

### Sufficiency

Similar qualified individuals from different groups should have similar chances of positive outcomes. Formally:

P(Y | Ŷ=y, A=a) = P(Y | Ŷ=y, A=a') for all values a, a' of A and all predictions y

This means the algorithm's predictions should be calibrated similarly across groups.

### Separation

False positive and false negative rates should be similar across different groups. Formally:

P(Ŷ=1 | Y=y, A=a) = P(Ŷ=1 | Y=y, A=a') for all values a, a' of A and all actual outcomes y

This means the algorithm should make similar types of errors across groups.

## Implementation Approaches

Group fairness can be implemented through:

1. **Pre-processing**: Modifying training data to remove biases
2. **In-processing**: Modifying learning algorithms to enforce fairness constraints
3. **Post-processing**: Adjusting algorithm outputs to ensure fair results across groups

## Challenges

Group fairness approaches face several challenges:

- **Data requirements**: Requires demographic data which may be unavailable or illegal to collect
- **Subgroup fairness**: May miss unfairness affecting intersectional subgroups
- **Metric selection**: Different metrics may conflict with each other
- **Contextual appropriateness**: The appropriate metric depends on the specific context

Group fairness approaches often require collecting and analyzing demographic data to identify and address disparities, which can raise privacy concerns and may be legally restricted in some contexts.
