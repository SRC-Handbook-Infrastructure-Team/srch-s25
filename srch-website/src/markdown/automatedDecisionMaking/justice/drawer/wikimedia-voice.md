### Case Study: WikiMedia Value-Sensitive Algorithm

Researchers at the University of Minnesota developed an "intelligent socialization algorithm" to help WikiProjects (self-organized groups within Wikipedia) identify and recruit suitable new members. Rather than designing the algorithm based solely on technical considerations, they employed "Value-Sensitive Algorithm Design", which incorporated stakeholders' explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation.

This process began with interviews of WikiProject organizers to understand their recruitment practices and values. The researchers then translated these qualitative insights into specific algorithmic features and constraints. For example, they learned that project organizers valued editing activity as well as subject-matter expertise, communication skills, and cultural fit. The algorithm was designed to respect these multidimensional criteria rather than optimizing for simple metrics like edit count. After deployment, the system actively collected feedback from both project organizers and invitees, which helped create a continuous improvement loop. The results were notable, as experienced newcomers who received algorithm-generated invitations showed increased participation in projects compared to control groups.

This case shows that meaningful voice in algorithmic systems doesn't require humanlike understanding but rather deliberate design choices that value stakeholder input throughout the development and deployment process. By creating structured channels for stakeholder feedback and actually incorporating this feedback into system design, the WikiProjects recruitment algorithm transformed user voice from a passive input into an active governance mechanism.
